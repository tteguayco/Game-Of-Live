# Conway's Game of Live Simulator

This simulator shows how cells evolve according to the cellular automaton called "Game of Life", created by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.

Rules
=====

In this automaton, every cell interacts with its eight neighbors following a certain set of rules:

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by **underpopulation**.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by **overpopulation**.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by **reproduction**.
